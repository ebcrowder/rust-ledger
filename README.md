# rust_ledger

command line accounting tool

As a former CPA, I could not resist building my own accounting system.

### Summary

- Spiritual port of [ledger](https://github.com/ledger/ledger)
- Uses double-entry accounting paradigm
- Small feature set based on typical use cases
- Uses `yaml` files as data store
- Includes a tool to convert `csv` files to `yaml` format

### Contributing

### Install

#### From Cargo 

`cargo install rust_ledger`

#### Build from Source

Alternatively, clone this repo and do the following:

- If Rust is not installed on your machine, follow the instructions on how to do that here: https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install
- run `cargo build --release` to compile the binary
- go to `/target/release` and copy the `rust_ledger` binary in your path: `/usr/bin`

### Usage

`rust_ledger -l LEDGER_FILE_PATH COMMAND -f OPTION`

LEDGER_FILE_PATH (denoted by `-l`) - relative path to location of yaml ledger file

  - Optionally, the ledger file path can be set via the environment variable `RLEDGER_FILE` in lieu of specifying whenever the program is invoked.
  - If `-l` is provided with a file path the file provided will be used instead of any `RLEDGER_FILE` set.

```
RLEDGER_FILE=~/rledger.yaml rust_ledger balances
```

`RLEDGER_FILE` can be set as a system or user environment variable.

```
export RLEDGER_FILE="$HOME/rledger.yaml"
```

COMMAND - ledger command (accounts, balance, register, or csv)

OPTION (denoted by `-f`) - allows you to filter the output of the `register` command by account type. For example, if you wish to only see "expense" transactions in the output, you would pass in `expense` as the option here.

### Environment Variables

`RLEDGER_FILE` - Path to rledger file. ex: `RLEDGER_FILE=~/rledger.yaml`

`NO_COLOR` - Disables color output. ex: `NO_COLOR=true`

### Features

#### Transactions

Transactions can be expressed in two different ways. One is a "simplified" format for transactions that only impact two accounts: 

```yaml
- date: 01/01/2020
  amount: 200
  offset_account: liability:credit_card_amex
  description: grocery store
  account: expense:expense_general
```

The sign (debit / credit) associated with the `offset_account` value is the opposite of the sign of the value contained in `amount` field.  

In the above example transaction, since `expense_general` was debited by 200, the `credit_card_amex` account will be credited by the same amount. 

Transactions that involve more than two accounts are expressed in the following manner:

```yaml
- date: 01/01/2020
  description: grocery store
  transaction:
    - amount: 20
      account: expense:general
    - amount: 180
      account: expense:grocery
    - amount: -200
      account: liability:credit_card_amex
```

Transactions that only involve two accounts can also be expressed in the above format. 

### Test

- `cargo test`

### API

- accounts
  - lists accounts
  - example output:

```
 Account                      
---------------------------------------
asset:cash_checking         
asset:cash_savings          
liability:credit_card_amex  
equity:equity               
expense:grocery             
expense:general             
expense:mortgage            
income:general   
```

- balance
  - lists account balances to date
  - example output:

```
 Account                       Balance             
---------------------------------------
asset
  asset:cash_checking          -700.00             
  asset:cash_savings           1000.00             
liability
  liability:credit_card_amex   -455.00             
equity
  equity:equity                -3500.00            
expense
  expense:grocery              635.00              
  expense:general              1020.00             
  expense:mortgage             2000.00             
income
  income:general               0                   

---------------------------------------
check                          0          
```

- register
  - lists general ledger transactions to date
  - can filter output by any field via optional parameter
  - example output:

```
Date       Description             Accounts            
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
11/4/2019  weekly groceries        expense:grocery           455.00      455.00
                                   expense:grocery          -455.00       0.00
07/04/2020 mortage                 expense:mortgage         2000.00     2000.00
                                   expense:mortgage        -2000.00       0.00
07/04/2020 stuff                   expense:general          1000.00     1000.00
                                   asset:cash_savings      -1000.00        0.00
06/21/2020 grocery store           expense:general            20.00       20.00
                                   expense:grocery           180.00      200.00
                                   asset:cash_checking      -200.00        0.00
```

- csv
  - converts `csv` files to `yaml` format expected by `rust_ledger`
  - most financial institutions (banks, credit unions and credit card companies) will provide exports of transaction history in `csv` format
  - **note** - prior to importing your `csv` file into the tool, you must rename the columns in the first line of the `csv` file in the following schema:
    `"date","transaction","name","memo","amount"`

### rust_ledger `yaml` file format

- example ledger `yaml` file can be found at `examples/example.yaml`
- rust_ledger utilizes `yaml` files in the following format:

```yaml
accounts:
  - account: 
    amount:  

transactions:
  - date: 
    amount: 
    description: 
    account: 
    offset_account: 
  - date: 
    description: 
    transaction: 
      - amount: 
        account: 
      - amount: 
        account: 
```

The ledger format schema is purposely lightweight. The only requirements are as follows:
    - the `account` field should be expressed in the following format: `account_classification:account_name`.
    - the `amount` field should be a number. It can include up to two (2) decimal points.  
    - the `date` field should be in the following format: `MM-DD-YYYY`.
